        <p>The orca (Orcinus orca), or killer whale, is a toothed whale and the largest member of the oceanic dolphin
            family. The
            only extant species in the genus Orcinus, it is recognizable by its distinct pigmentation; being mostly
            black on top,
            white on the bottom and having recognizable white eye patches. A cosmopolitan species, it inhabits a wide
            range of
            marine environments, from Arctic to Antarctic regions to tropical seas, but is more commonly documented in
            temperate or
            cooler coastal waters. Scientists have proposed dividing the global population into races, subspecies, or
            possibly even
            species.

            Orcas are apex predators with a diverse diet. Individual populations often specialize in particular types of
            prey,
            including bony fish, sharks, rays, and marine mammals such as seals, dolphins, and whales. They are highly
            social, with
            some populations forming stable matrilineal family groups (pods). Their sophisticated hunting techniques and
            vocal
            behaviors, often unique to specific groups and passed down from generation to generation, are considered to
            be
            manifestations of animal culture. The most studied populations are off the west coast of North America,
            which include
            fish-eating "residents", mammal-eating "transients", and offshores.

            The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the orca's conservation status as data
            deficient as
            multiple orca types may represent distinct species. Some local populations are threatened or endangered due
            to prey
            depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs), captures for marine parks, and conflicts with fisheries. In
            late 2005, the
            southern resident orcas were added to the U.S. Endangered Species list.

            Orcas have been revered by indigenous peoples while Western cultures have historically feared them. They
            have been taken
            by whalers when stocks of larger species have declined. The orca's image took a positive turn in the 1960s,
            due to
            greater public and scientific awareness and their display in captivity. Since then, orcas have been trained
            to perform
            in marine parks, a practice that has been criticized as unethical. Orcas rarely pose a threat to humans, and
            no fatal
            attack has been recorded in the wild. However, captive orcas have injured or killed their handlers in marine
            theme
            parks.

            Naming
            Orcas are often referred to as "killer whales" because ancient sailors saw them hunt larger whales.[6] Since
            the 1960s,
            the term "orca" has increasingly replaced "killer whale" in common usage.[7]

            Although some sources suggest that Orcinus means 'of the kingdom of the dead',[8] the International Code of
            Zoological
            Nomenclature (ICZN) mentions that the name orca originates from the Latin word orca, meaning 'a
            large-bellied pot.'
            Orcinus is a derived form created by adding a masculine suffix to it.[9] Ancient Romans originally used
            orca[10] (pl.
            orcae) for these animals, possibly borrowing Ancient Greek ὄρυξ (óryx), which was used for various whale
            species
            potentially including the narwhal.[11]

            They are sometimes referred to as 'blackfish', a term also used for other cetaceans. Historically, 'grampus'
            was another
            name for the species,[12] though it is now rarely used. This usage should not be confused with the genus
            Grampus, which
            includes only Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus).[13]

            Orcinus citoniensis fossil, an extinct species of the same genus, Museo Capellini in Bologna

            Modern orca skeleton, Naturalis, Leiden
            Orcinus orca is the only extant species recognized in the genus Orcinus and one of many species originally
            described by
            Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae.[14] Conrad Gessner wrote the first
            scientific
            description of an orca in his Piscium & aquatilium animantium natura of 1558, part of the larger Historia
            animalium,
            based on examination of a dead stranded animal in the Bay of Greifswald that had attracted a great deal of
            local
            interest.[15]</p>
