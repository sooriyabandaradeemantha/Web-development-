Orcas, often called killer whales, are actually the largest members of the dolphin family, but young or small orcas—like
calves—are much tinier compared to adults. Orca calves are usually born around 2.4 meters (8 feet) long and weigh about
180 kilograms, which is small compared to full-grown males that can reach up to 9.8 meters and weigh 5,500 kilograms.
Despite their size at birth, calves are strong swimmers and stay close to their mothers for protection and nursing.
Orcas live in tight family groups called pods, and even the smallest members play an important role in learning hunting
skills and social behaviors. Their distinctive black-and-white coloring is present from birth, making them recognizable
even as small calves.
